## {{< param title >}}

Unlike the other albums so far, the photos in this one weren't shot on film, but rather a Fujifilm X-E3 that my friend let me borrow. I really had a fun time shooting on it and trying the film simulations, although I had the grain simulation off for most of them!
One of my favorite features of the camera was the film simulation bracketing. I got 3 photos from each shot. One with a Kodak simulation, one with a vibrant simulation, and one with a black and white through a yellow filter simulation. Some things that I thought would look good in one would end up looking better in another. I never shoot in black and white either, but I dended up liking those the most I think.
