The first two photos are from the same day as my trip around the East-side of Tokyo <a href="/photos/2025-05-03~11_kawagoe_and_east_tokyo">2025-05-03~11</a> and the rest are from a 05-20 when I visited the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo (MOT) and 05-22 when I went to Yokohama to attend a baseball game.<br>
Shot on Escura Edo Ukiyo-E 400.
