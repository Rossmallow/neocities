I've been a fan of Godzilla from childhood and in the past few years I got back into Godzilla after getting the Criterion Showa Era Collection. I found out that There was an event in Shinjuku called Tokyo Night & Light where they project short films onto the side of the Metropolitan Government Building, including some featuring Godzilla.<br>
I was able to see two showings of each that night. The first set were in the intended location, in a plaza just under the building, but I saw a nice viewing spot on the way over and thought it would be cool to take some pictures from afar as if really seeing Godzilla in the distance. If you squint your eyes a bit, I think some of these photos can accomplish that feeling.<br>
The rest of the photos I took between showing as I rushed from the Metropolitan building back to Kitamura Camera to pick up my pictures from earlier in the day (<a href="/photos/film/2025-06-08_ikebukuro">2025-06-08 (Ikebukuro)</a>) before they closed.<br>
Shot on Marix 800T.
