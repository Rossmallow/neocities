I took a short 2-day trip to Hiroshima from June 14th to 15th. This is one of the places I've really wanted to visit for many years, and despite having been to Japan 4-5 times already, I never got around to going. I had a free weekend so I made a point of finally checking this destination off.<br>
After a 5 hour shinkansen ride from Tokyo, I arrived in Hiroshima with an overcast sky and some medium rainfall. It was the perfect somber atmosphere for a solemn experience at the Atomic Bomb Memorial sites. It was a mix of heavy emotions wandering around the area where two months shy of 80 years ago, an atomic bomb was first dropped on a city - on civilians. Maybe the most heartbreaking for me was the Children's Peace Memorial, which shows a girl holding a paper crane above her head.<br>
Along with the pictures of the memorials, this album contains a few pictures from the Shukkeien Garden, on the second day, with much better weather.<br>
