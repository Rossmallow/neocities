<h2 id="title">{{< param title >}}</h2>

Similarly to the Yashica Ruby 60s film from <a href="/photos/2025-03-22~25">2025-03-22~25</a>, this film is very desaturated so I unfortunately lost some great color I was hoping to capture, especially in some of the flowers I shot, but I do think I ended up with some nice photos in the end.<br>
Shot on Escura Showa Camera Film 400.
