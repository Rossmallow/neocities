As has become tradition for me to do on days off, I took the Metra up to Lake Forest this Labor Day weekend. The last time I went to Lake Forest was on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, but it was bitterly cold that day. I could hardly last a few minutes outside so I decided to come back in the summer to get some more pictures. There happened to be an art fair that weekend so I enjoyed wandering around it and enjoying other people's art while I try to capture my own.

I think I'm getting better at photography. My primary metric is how many photos on each roll I want to upload here. I try to keep the cap at 10 per roll/album, but it's getting harder and harder to get down to just 10 images. I hope you enjoy the ones I did choose though.
