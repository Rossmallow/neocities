<h2 id="title">{{< param title >}}</h2>

I had a day off for MLK day and decided to go up to Lake Forest and try out some black & white film I bought. This was my first time trying B&W film and it looks like I overexposed most of the shots.
Also, that day was a bad day to go out. It was so bitterly cold, I could barely stay outside for more than a few minutes. I spent most of my time in the library which was a cool building. It felt very old and cramped, but it was charming.
I also went to a restaurant that felt like it had been around for a long time too.<br>
Because it was so cold, I didn't manage to finish the roll until months later when I was preparing for my trip to Japan. I snapped a few frames from around my apartment just to finish the roll so I could avoid putting it through the x-ray machines at the airport.<br>
I didn't get around to dropping this roll off for development until after I got back from Japan, and then I was told I wouldn't get the scans and negatives back for another two months. I'm writing this in November, and I just got the scans back.<br>
