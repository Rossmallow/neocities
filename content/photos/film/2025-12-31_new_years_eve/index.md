I took these when I went out to lunch with my friends on the eve of 2026. The photos are pretty overexposed. It was an overcast day and I used 800ISO film. I probably should have used something less sensative, but there were a few photos that turned out okay. This isn't my proudest roll.

Shot on Marix 800T.
