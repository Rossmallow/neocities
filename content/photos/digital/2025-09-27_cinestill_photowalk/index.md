It was a beatuful day and band rehearsal was canceled so I decided to go out shooting. I got some wonderful shots and just as I was about to finish up while walking along the river, I noticed someone had a cool vintage camera, then I noticed another person, and another person. I realized that I had stumbled upon a photowalk event and asked someone about it. It turns out that CineStill was hosting a photowalk so I joined in for the last half hour or so. It was a cool experience to meet some other photographers.
The day was so beautiful and I think I got some great photos. It was very hard for me to cull this collection down to just 10 to share here. This list could have turned out very differently if I did it on a different day or was in a different mood, but this is the list I chose. Please enjoy.<br>
