This was my third time going to Philly and also my third consecutive time attending Bubba Bash, a Musical Tribute to Neil Peart of Rush. Dispite having been to Philly for Bubba Bash before, this is the first time I spent any significant amount of time wandering around downtown and also the first time I brought a camera with me.
I brought my Fujifilm X-T10, but unlike most, if not all, of my previous X-T10 uploads, I didn't use the disposable camera lens. For Christmas, my dad gifted me a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCHX2G78/?th=1">25mm F2 TTArtisan lens</a> which I used for all of these photos. I had a lot of fun using an adjustable lens with my Fuji for a change. I love the disposable lens but being able to adjust aperture and focus gives so much more flexiblity and is just more fun.
I brought two of my 2GB SD cards with me. I used up just over half of the first one on my first day, and after I finished it in the morning I couldn't find the other. Thinking I lost it, I went to <a href="https://www.uniquephoto.com/philadelphia">Unique Photo</a> to pick up a new 128GB card. Since I wasn't limited by the number of photos available to me like I normally would be, I did go a bit overboard and took over 150 photos rather than the ~40 the 2GB card limits me to. I tried my best to narrow down the few best photos between the two cards to share here.
