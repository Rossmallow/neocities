<h2 id="title">{{< param title >}}</h2>

This is the first album that I shot with my X-T10. I used a 2GB SD card to limit myself to ~40 shots. I also got a Utulens by Gizmon from Amazon in Japan. It's one of those disposable camera lenses. I put my shutter speed and iso on auto and used the camera like a disposable point-n-shoot. Between the limited storage space, the Fuji film simulations, and the lens, it was a fun bit of nostalgia.
