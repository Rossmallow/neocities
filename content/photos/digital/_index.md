<h3>Backstory</h3>

<!-- p tags because Hugo doesn't put them around the first paragraph for some reason -->
<p>After about a year of wanting a Fujifilm camera, I finally found a good deal on an X-T10 in a camera shop in Shinjuku called Five Star Camera. I had specifically been wanting an X-T20, which has a few quality-of-life upgrades, among the upgraded sensor with a higher megapixel count and an additional film simulation not found on the X-T10. This was the best deal I had found, though, so I figured I'd get this now, and if I want to upgrade in the future, I could trade in my X-T10.</p>

The camera body was selling for ¥52800 JPY, which was about $370 USD at the time of purchase. I also bought a kit lens with the body for ¥26800 JPY, or about $190 USD. In total, and free from paying Japanese tax, I was able to get both the camera body and the lens for ¥72364 JPY, or about $500 USD, with a one-month warranty from the shop. A great deal, I think.

I'm not so sure if the deal on the lens is as good as the one on the body, but the kit lens is good enough for now. I do intend to get a prime lens and maybe will trade in this XC 15-45mm f3.5-5.6 zoom lens when I do. One thing channels like <a href="https://www.youtu.be/Dfr8Plzw2ks">Zenography</a> suggest is to try using the X-T10 with vintage lenses. From the pictures I've seen, they go far beyond the film simulations in making the photos look filmic, so I'm really excited to try that on my camera. I've got a few lenses for my Miranda camera at home that aren't getting any use otherwise, so I intend to try them.
