I went to Waterfall Glen in Lemont Illinois for an autumn hike with my friends. We walked about 10 miles in total and had a lot of fun together. I'm proud that we made it through the whole path.
I usually stick to one film simulation recipie, but I've been wanting to shoot in B&W recently, so today I decided to try the monochrome recipie from <a href="https://fujixweekly.com/2020/01/21/first-fujifilm-x-t1-film-simulation-recipes/">Fuji X Weekly</a>, which I'll include below.

<p>
Film Simulation: Monochrome (+Y, +R, +G)<br>
Dynamic Range: DR200<br>
Highlight: +1 (Medium-High)<br>
Shadow: +1 (Medium-High)<br>
Sharpness : +1 (Medium -Hard)<br>
Noise Reduction: -2 (Low)<br>
ISO: Auto, up to ISO 6400<br>
