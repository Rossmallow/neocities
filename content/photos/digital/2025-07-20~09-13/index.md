It's been a while since I went shooting. Since I've come back from Japan, I've fallen back into my regular habits and rituals, and I haven't gone shooting very much. After taking a handful of photos in July, this SD card has practically been collecting dust until I decided to take it with me this weekend to go see Spinal Tap 2, and visit Central Camera to get a couple rolls of film developed that I should be uploading soon.
I've been inspired by my friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cicada1031/">Mitsuru</a> and the photos he takes which tend to be close up, with lots of contrast and/or texture. They can be a bit disorienting because you're not sure what the picture is of. I tried to take a few shots like that. One of them being the <a href="#shadow.webp">shadow</a>. I've also been inspired by another Chicago photographer named <a href="https://www.instagram.com/edgar.creative/">Edgar Corona</a>. He has a couple much better photos by the Crown Fountain, but I found myself over there today and I like to think that <a href="#argument.webp">the argument photo</a> is somewhat in his style.
