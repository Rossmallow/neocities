I took these with the disposable camera lens on a day trip to Kawagoe.<br>
The 2GB SD card I mentioned in my last post failed towards the end of being full. I'm not exactly sure what happened but I got a message on my camera about a data error while saving a photo and after I turned the camera off and on again I saw there were no photos on the card. I was, however, able to recover most of them by using this <a href=https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec>PhotoRec</a> software which I'm very grateful for.
