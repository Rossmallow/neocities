I went out to a few places East of Tokyo with my friends from Canada who live in Japan. They also shoot Fujifilm so they brought some of their own lenses and we swapped them around so these photos were shot on various lenses between the following: Fuji XF21mmF2, Fuji XF18mmF2 R, my Fuji XC15-45mmF3.5-5.6, and my Gizmon Utulens (disposable camera lens). You can see the difference between my Utulens and a the Fuji XF21mmF2 lens with the boat pictures.
