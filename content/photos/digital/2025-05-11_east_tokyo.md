I went out to a few places in East Tokyo with my friends from Canada who live in Japan. They also shoot Fujifilm so they brought some of their own lenses and we swapped them around so these were shot on various lenses. You can see the difference between my disposable camera lens and a nice Fujinon lens with the boat pictures.
