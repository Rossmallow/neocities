    <p>Hi, Welcome to my site!<br>
      I don't have much experience with web design, but after finding Neocities and seeing what others were doing with it, I was excited to do the same.</p>
    <p>I have a few hobbies like photography and music that I am documenting on this site.<br> 
      You can vew photos that I've taken, read about my favorite bass gear, and check out some of my favorite YouTube videos.</p>
    <p>Thanks for hanging out!<br>
      - Ross Nelson</p>
