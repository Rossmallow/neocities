      creator: deeper sleeper
      description: I love this animation and music individually, but in combination they play off of each other really well. The agressive and distorted drums with the bouncy bass set the foundation for the melodic second bass track and the tragic vocals with heavy reverb on all elements. The animation feels like something from MTV with all the movement and being hand drawn. Stepping through frame by frame, it's easy to tell that each element is hand drawn and reveals a lot of details of how things rotate and morph into each other. It's all very impressive.
